              4.1 We will require any third party to whom we provide your
              personal information to agree to comply with our Privacy Policy in
              force at that time or requirements substantially similar to such
              policy. We will make reasonable commercial efforts to ensure that
              they comply with such policy or requirements, however, where not
              expressly prohibited by law, we will have no liability to you if
              any third party fails to do so. We shall require any third party,
              including without limitation any government or enforcement entity,
              seeking access to data to obtain a court order, or equivalent
              proof that they are statutorily empowered to access your data and

              4.2 We take reasonable administrative, physical and electronic
              measures designed to protect the information that we collect from

              copying, unauthorized modification or destruction, unauthorized
              access, use or disclosure. Notwithstanding, LockSpread cannot
              assure or guarantee that any third party with which LockSpread
              shares information will comply with its obligations regarding such
              information. Furthermore, even though appropriate measures are
              used to prevent unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot
              assure you that any personal identification information collected
              or received by us will never be disclosed in a manner that is
              inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, and do not accept liability
              for any unintentional disclosure.

              LockSpread, in its sole discretion, may include or offer third
              party links, products, advertisements, or services (collectively,
              “Third Party Websites”) via the Website. Additionally, LockSpread
              may make its Services available through Third Party Websites.
              LockSpread is not responsible for the actions of Third Party
              Websites. This Privacy Policy does not cover any collection or use
              of information that Third Party Websites may collect from you, or
              the practices used by third parties to collect such information,
              and Third Party Websites should have separate and independent
              privacy policies and terms of use for the purpose of collecting
              personal information about you. You should consult such Third
              Party Websites’ privacy policy, and LockSpread has and assumes
              absolutely no responsibility or liability whatsoever for the
              activities of Third Party Websites. If you decide to use, click
              on, access, or provide any personal information to Third Party

              6.1 When you pay fees through the Website, we may process your
              payments through a Third Party Website, including, without
              limitation, third-party payment processers. The Third Party
              Website may collect certain financial information from you in
              order to process a payment, including your name, email address,
              address and other billing information. In order to delete your
              payment or billing information, you may need to do so with the
              Third Party Website, as LockSpread only has minimal secure access

              the Website and Services, and thereafter so long as needed for
              purposes that are not prohibited by applicable law. Before we use

              originally authorized by you or set forth in this Privacy Policy,
              we will use best efforts to provide details regarding the new

              where consent is required to process any personal information
              pursuant to applicable law or contract, we will use best efforts
              to comply with such law or contract.

              inaccurate. If you want us to delete your personal information,
              please contact us at [support@lockspread.com] with your request
              and/or follow the necessary procedures provided through the

              can, but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for

              9.2 LockSpread will use best efforts to provide you with access to

              which we are unable to provide access, including but not limited
              to: (i) where the information contains legal privilege, (ii) would
              compromise others’ privacy or legitimate rights, (iii) where the
              burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to
              the risks to your privacy, or (iv) where it is commercially
              proprietary. If we determine that access should be restricted in
              any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation
              of why that determination has been made and a contact point for
              any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, we will take
              commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before

              12.1 Under California’s “Shine the Light” law, California
              residents have the right to opt out of disclosing personal
              information to third parties for the purpose of allowing such
              third parties to directly market their products and services. If
              you wish to opt out, you may do so in accordance with the terms
              set forth in this Privacy Policy. Under California law (and as a
              result of your ability to opt out as set forth in this Privacy
              Policy), we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of
              third parties that received your personal information for
              marketing purposes
            </p>
            <p>
              Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), California
              consumers have the following rights, which can be exercised
              directly or in certain cases, through an authorized agent:

                  information about the categories and sources of personal
                  information we collect, our purposes for collecting the
                  information, and the types of third parties that receive that
                  information. Details about our data collection, use and
                  third-party disclosures can be found in this Policy. In
                  addition, they have the right to request a copy of their
                  Personal Data. They may exercise this right once per 12-month
                  period by submitting a request to us at
                  [support@lockspread.com].
                </li>
                <li>
                  Right to Delete. California customers have the right to

                  that we have about them, subject to certain exceptions (i.e.
                  information used to provide Services, complete transactions,

                  Right to Opt-Out of Sale of personal information. California
                  customers have the right to opt out of the sale of their
                  personal information, and to request information about whether
                  we have sold their personal information in the past 12 months.
                  We do not sell personal information. Should such change, we
                  will notify users and provide an ability to opt out as

              information you are inquiring about. We will not be able to
              fulfill your request until we can do so. In general, we verify
              identity by confirming that you are the owner of the email address
              associated with the account. An authorized agent submitting a
              request on your behalf must also have access to the email address
              associated with the account, along with sufficient evidence that
              you have authorized that person to submit the request on your
              behalf.
