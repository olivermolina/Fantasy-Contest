          </h1>
          <p>
            The following provides information regarding the measures LLSS
            Enterprises, Inc. d/b/a LockSpread (“LockSpread,” “we,” “us,” or
            “our”) has put in place in order to ensure a fair, safe, and
            responsible gaming environment regarding your use of the
            [https://www.lockspread.com/] website and the LockSpread mobile
            application (together, or individually, the “Service“).
          </p>
          <p className={'font-semibold underline'}>Self-Exclusion:</p>
          <p>
            You may voluntarily self-exclude yourself from accessing the Website
            and Services at any time. You may ask for your account to be closed
            or restricted by emailing us at [support@lockspread.com]. Your
            request must include your full name, full residential address, and
            email address so we may verify your account and block your access to
            the Services. The self- exclusion will last for a period of at least
            three (3) months, and will only be lifted seven (7) days after we
            receive your written email requesting to reinstate your account. By
            voluntarily self-excluding, you agree to provide full and accurate
            personal details, now and in the future, so as to allow access to,
            and/or use of, our Services to be restricted. If you choose to
            self-exclude, we will use all reasonable endeavors to ensure we
            comply with your self-exclusion. However in agreeing to self-exclude
            you accept that you have a parallel undertaking not to attempt to
            circumvent voluntary self-exclusion. Accordingly, we have no
            responsibility or liability for any subsequent consequences or
            losses, howsoever caused, that you may suffer or incur if you
            commence or continue to access or make use of the Website through
            additional online accounts in circumstances where you have changed
            any of the registration details or you provide misleading,
            inaccurate or incomplete details or otherwise seek to circumvent the
            voluntary self- exclusion to which you agreed.
          </p>
          <p>
            During a period of self-exclusion, we will use reasonable efforts to
            not send you any marketing material and we will not accept any
            deposits or entries from you. During a period of self- exclusion,
            you may not open a new account. We will not reopen any self-excluded
            account prior to the three (3) month mandatory self-exclusion
            period; however, after the expiry of the exclusion period you may
            contact us and ask for your account to be re-activated.
          </p>
          <p className={'font-semibold underline'}>Self-Limitation:</p>
          <p>
            LockSpread recommends that you set daily limits in order to avoid
            abusing the Services. LockSpread provides you the option to set
            daily, weekly, or monthly deposit limitations. You may lower a limit
            at any time by contacting us at [support@lockspread.com]. This
            election, to lower your deposit limit, will take effect thereafter.
            You may request the previous limit set limit to be increased or
            removed. Self-limitation is in addition to the limitations imposed
            by LockSpread in accordance with applicable state law(s), which
            limitations will be enforced if they are exceeded, regardless of
            your own self-imposed limitations.
          </p>
          <p className={'font-semibold underline'}>Problem Gaming Resources:</p>

            losses.

            Third Party Exclusion Requests:
          </p>
          <p>
            If you believe that a member of your family is a problem gamer,
            please contact us at [support@lockspread.com].
          </p>
          <p>
            Third parties may request that a family member be excluded from the
            Website or the Services, or request the setting of deposit or loss
            limits for the family member. In order to process such requests,
            LockSpread will require any of the following information: (1)
            evidence of sole or joint financial responsibility for the source of
            any funds deposited with LockSpread; (2) proof that the requesting
            party is jointly obligated on the credit or debit card associated
            with the family member’s LockSpread account; (3) proof of legal
            dependency of the family member on the requesting party under
            federal or state law; (3) proof of the existence of a court order
            that makes the requesting party wholly or partially obligated for
            the debts of the family member; or (4) proof of the existence of a
            court order requiring the family member to pay unmet child support
            obligations, alimony payments, and/or any other familial-related
            financial obligations.
          </p>
          <p>
            LockSpread may also request additional identifiable verification
            documentation validating the relationship between the requesting
            party and the family member.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon receipt of a valid request, LockSpread will use best efforts to
            contact the user via email associated with the account requested to
            be excluded and/or limited. The user will have five (5) business
            days (“Dispute Period”) from the date we send email notification of
            the request to dispute the request. If the user does not dispute the
            request within the Dispute Period or LockSpread deems, in its sole
            discretion, that the information provided is insufficient to refute
            the request, it will be honored and the exclusion or restriction
            shall be enforced.

            age of 18 (or higher in certain jurisdictions) to register an
            account to access the Website or Services. In the event you believe

            Services, please contact us at [support@lockspread.com].
